def parallel(n_proc_list):
    """
    @pytest_parallel.mark.parallel([2,3])
    def test_fun(comm):
        pass

    is equivalent to

    `@pytest.mark.parametrize('comm', [2,3], indirect=['comm'])`
    def test_fun(comm):
        pass

    Details
      What is subtle here is that 'comm' means 3 different things
        - the first 'comm' (in `parametrize('comm')`) is a "call_spec"
        - the second 'comm' (in `indirect=['comm']`) is a "fixture",
              which in our case is a function that takes a `request`,
              extracts info from it
              and returns it to the function `test_fun` as a parameter
        - the comm parameter of function `test_fun`, which is the returned value of the fixture
      What happens is that:
        - PyTest will take the "callspec" 'comm' (of value 2 or 3)
        - this will be passed to `pytest_parallel.pytest_collection_modifyitems` that will create a communicator
        - we ask for `indirect` because we don't want value 2 or 3 as our 'comm' fixture
            we rather want the communicator created by `pytest_parallel.pytest_collection_modifyitems`
            With `indirect=['comm']`, we tell PyTest to use fixture `comm` to compute the argument
            we want to use in the function body
